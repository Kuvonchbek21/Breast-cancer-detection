**Project : Breast-cancer-detection**

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. It accounts for 25 percent of all cancer cases. Breast cancer begins with the uncontrolled growth of cells in the breast. These cells are usually detected by analyzing tumors that can be seen through X-rays.

This dataset was taken from Kaggle.

- These results indicate that the model has high accuracy and reliably distinguishes between benign and malignant categories. The high recall value further confirms the model's sensitivity in detecting disease cases.And this result indicates that the model is highly reliable for integration into medical practice.
- I found that : the size measurements in sick people are higher compared to those who are not sick
